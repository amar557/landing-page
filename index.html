        <h3>
          At A Dog Person, we believe our furry friends deserve nothing but the
          best.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our journey began with two dedicated dog parents, Emily and Mukasa, in
          London. Their beloved dog Teddy, who you'll see featured throughout
          our story, inspired them to create something special after
          experiencing common health issues like skin problems, joint pain, and
          poor nutrition. When Teddy crossed the rainbow bridge, Emily and
          Mukasa became determined to develop products that genuinely improve
          the health and happiness of dogs everywhere.

          The pet industry is notorious for prioritising profits over pets,
          often using low-quality ingredients and fillers.
        </h2>
        <p>
          At A Dog Person, we stand against this trend. Our mission is to offer
          supplements made from transparent, high-quality ingredients that truly
          make a difference. We believe in being open about what goes into our
          products because we know that as a true dog person, you want nothing
          but the best for your fur babies.
